We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

You know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
with volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day
You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

Time
has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do

So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down your spine

They are all missing on what life is about

Put the victim on the front lines and left for dead.

Erase the proof... erase the proof but your shame will remain.

Can you hold the water... can you hold the water responsible for your wayward behavior, any more than it blames you for its gripping currents?

How can this be? We've come so far

Let this burden drift away.

Nothing has changed
I wont stand and watch

I stand by you
Through all of the years
I've been with you

Through pain and affliction
With every addiction
I will never let you down

I will live by this code!
Never surrender
You and I are one

Of the storm
You are never alone
Even through, the shadows
You are never alone

After all this time
Still you struggle
Even words of love
Ring so hollow

I have no regrets
I have no remorse
And if you falter
I wont let you down

Through the eye
Of the storm
you are never alone
Even through, the shadows
You are never alone

Come on

Together we stand
Never fall
No matter the trial
We will overcome
Together we stand
Never fall
No matter the Trial

Where the weight of my burden
Eclipses my resolve
This broken path I've chosen
I walk it alone
Though I feel forgotten
You've carved my name in stone

In these desperate times
This I plead
When all else fails
Remember me

This is daily crucifixion
And these rusty nails leave scars
My jagged crown is on my side
Because it never fell

In these desperate times
This I plead
When all else fails
Remember me

This is a blood-oath
They are nothing to me anymore
But your voice means more to me than you'll ever know

There's no question
You're the answer
I will find you...

How passive can we be before humanity is lost?

That bars your heart from feeling this
Dedicate yourself
Give your souls to compassion

With open arms embrace this heart
With open eyes behold the truth
Embrace this life

So little time is left
We must be relentless
In our pursuit of those in torment
