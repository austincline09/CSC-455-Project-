Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call say 'beware doll, you're bound to fall'
You thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
A complete unknown, like a rolling stone
Ah you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discovered that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To have on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
Ahh princess on a steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking, thinking that they've got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel, ah how does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone")

The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun, she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming, she moans, I've just been made
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And says, My advice is to not let the boys in
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride

Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, Death to all those who would whimper and cry
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Saying, The sun's not yellow, it's chicken

Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him, he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes

The geometry of innocence, flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks' home and the college
Now, I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues, oh right")

They are spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, Get outta here if you don't know
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting, Which side are you on?!
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row

When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke

It's hard to please your mind
When you've broken the heart of many a poor boy
But you'll never break this heart of mine
The blackest crow that ever flew
Will never turn to white
If you will prove your love to me
I'd turn my day to night
Well, it's hard to love and not be loved
It's hard to please your mind
When you've broken the heart of many a poor boy
But you'll never break this heart of mine
Oh Lord
No you'll never break this heart of mine")

	(1016,1015,"Down the track this morning she did stroll
In an accident her foot got caught in a hole
I'm going to tell you the truth
Die for a touch of that cold hand
I'd be crying every time the Southern makes it's run
I'm going to buy them all
Cigarettes and chewing tobacco when I can
Trials and troubles are heavy for me
She's a ramblin' gal
Bound to leave her home
I begged my brown skin
Please don't leave me alone
I'm going to make amends
Bound to cry to touch her hand
I'm going to ride that line
'Till I see that black train come
I'm going to buy them all
Cigarettes and chewing tobacco when I can
Trials and troubles are heavy for me
Now people that Southern Pacific make her run
From Chapel Hill to the state of Washington
Round the bend at 40 miles
20 tons of loaded frieght a-comin' on
Florscheim's stuck and it won't come out
My good gal's dead and gone
I'm going to buy them all
Cigarettes and chewing tobacco when I can
Trials and troubles are heavy for me
Trials and troubles are heavy for me")

	(1017,1016,"Now the way things look around this town
Better find a pretty woman before the sun goes down
If you need a place to lay your head
Find a pretty little woman in a pretty big bed
You make like a fool, you stumble around
Better find you a woman before you buy another round
In like a lamb and out like a lion
One minute your laughin' the next you're cryin'
It's hard to tell, hard to tell
You gotta get a woman, it's hard to tell
Can't be sure, can't be sure
Is she gonna be your pretty little girl?
Your pretty little girl
Better cut your hair, comb that mop
Shine them shoes, wear tails and top
Trim that 'stache, don't be slow
You gonna need it where you got to go
Hit that trail ride that roan
And buck that limb when you get her back home
Buckle up boys don’t think twice
And love that woman with all your might
It's hard to tell, hard to tell
You gotta get a woman, it's hard to tell
Can't be sure, can't be sure
Is she gonna be your pretty little girl?
Your pretty little girl
Now she don't call and she don't write
You're home with your mother every Saturday night
You see her on the town, she don't see you
You oughta quit courtin' and take up booze
You gotta make it look like a big fortune,
Got Calico shorts and alligator shoes
There ain’t no woman gonna waste her time,
Waiting for a poor boy to drag her down
It's hard to tell, hard to tell
You gotta get a woman, it's hard to tell
Can't be sure, can't be sure
Is she gonna be your pretty little girl?
Your pretty little girl")

Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me
Some birds' feathers are too bright to be caged
I know I'm not that colorful but a bird just the same
Open up your gate now, let me put down my load
So I can feel at ease and go back to my home
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me
Sun beatin' down, my legs can't seem to stand
There's a boss man at a turnrow with a rifle in his hand
I've got nine children, nothin' in the pan
My wife she died hungry while I was plowin' land
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me
Can't see when I go to work, can't see when I get off
How do you expect a man not to get lost
Every year I just keep getting deeper in debt
If there's a happy day, Lord, I haven't seen one yet
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me
Land that I love is the land that I'm workin'
But it's hard to love it all the time when your back is a-hurtin'
Gettin' too old now to push this here plow
Please let me lay down so I can look at the clouds
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me
Land that I know is where two rivers collide
The Brazos the Navaho and the big blue sky
Flood plains, freight trains, watermelon vines
Of any place on God's green earth, this is where I choose to die
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me")

	(1019,1018,"Well my friends, I see your face so clearly
Little bit tired, little worn through the years
You sound nervous, you seem alone
I hardly recognize your voice on the telephone
In between I remember
Just before bound-up, broken-down
We drive out to the edge of the highway
Follow that lonesome dead-end roadside south
We're all in this thing together
Walkin' the line between faith and fear
This life don't last forever
When you cry I taste the salt in your tears
Well my friend, let's put this thing together
And walk the path with worn out feet of trial
'Cause if you wanted we can go home forever
give up your jaded ways, spell your name to God
We're all in this thing together
Walkin' the line between faith and fear
This life don't last forever
When you cry I taste the salt in your tears
All the hour there's a picture in a mirror
Fancy shoes to grace our feet
All there is is a slow road to freedom
Heaven above and the devil beneath
We're all in this thing together
Walkin' the line between faith and fear
This life don't last forever
When you cry I taste the salt in your tears")

	(1020,1019,"Headed down south to the land of the pines
And I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road
Pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh
I can see my baby tonight
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now
Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me")
